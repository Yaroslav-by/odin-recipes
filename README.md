# odin-recipes
I've learnt "the basic" of basics of HTML: 
1. Structure of HTML file;
2. Headers;
3. Paragraphs;
4. Unordered and ordered lists;
5. Links and images (relatives and absolute paths);
6. Tags and attributes;
7. Git basics.
This project is about practising knowledge, that i got now. I will create website with different 
recipes, using only HTML. Then I will decorate in with CSS probably.
