    <p class="text">
        This blinchiki or blini recipe is a popular Russian dish widely consumed during the Maslenitsa 
        festival. All kinds of sweet and savory fillings are possible. Don't worry if the first few don't 
        turn out right; you'll get the hang of it.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="text italic">
        <li>4 cups milk</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon citric acid powder</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>2/3 cup butter, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>

        <li>
            Beat together milk and eggs in a large bowl until combined. Beat in sugar and salt. Mix in baking soda and 
            citric acid until incorporated. Blend in flour, a little at a time, until combined. Beat in oil. 
            Pour in boiling water, stirring constantly, until batter is thin and watery. Let rest for about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Pick the pan up off the heat. 
            Pour in a ladleful of batter while you rotate your wrist, tilting the pan, so batter forms a circle and 
            coats the bottom. The blini should be very thin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the pan to the heat. Cook blini for 90 seconds. Carefully lift up edge of blini to see if it's fully
            cooked: edges will be golden and bottom surface should have brown spots. Flip blini over and cook 
            for 1 minute more.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer blini to a plate lined with a clean kitchen towel. Continue cooking remaining batter, adding 1 
            tablespoon butter to the pan for every 4 blinis. Stack blinis and cover with another kitchen towel to 
            keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread desired filling in the center of each blini. Fold 3 times to make a triangle shape or fold up 
            all 4 sides, like a small burrito.
        </li>
    </ol>
